# Silly things

This is a list of silly things created by fellow data scientists.

This was sparked by my own experience of creating [something silly](https://github.com/fontikar/ohwhaley) because I wanted to learn 
how to write an R package and wanted to see what other silly things other folks have created.

I want to celebrate their silliness because data science/programming is not limited to work only.

I put [this call](https://fosstodon.org/@fontikar/113240067568472286) on Mastodon and the responses formed the basis of this list.

Feel free to submit a PR to add more silly things! 

Enjoy!
